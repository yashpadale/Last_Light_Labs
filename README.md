## ⚠️ Limitations of Current Computing Systems

- Excessive heat generation due to densely packed transistors
- High energy consumption and poor efficiency at scale
- Limited scalability without complex and costly cooling systems
- Bottlenecks in parallel processing for certain high-performance tasks

## 🌟 Why Optical Over Electrical?

- ⚡ **Ultra-Low Power:** consume significantly less energy than transistors, especially when pulsed.
- 🔥 **Minimal Heat:** Optical systems generate negligible heat, eliminating the need for complex cooling mechanisms.
- 🚀 **High Parallelism:** Light-based units can operate in massive parallel arrays, outperforming traditional architectures in scale.
- 🌐 **Faster Propagation:** Light travels faster than electrons through copper, reducing latency in signal transmission.
- 📦 **Compact & Scalable:** As component sizes shrink, more logic units can be embedded in smaller spaces without overheating.

## 🚀 Impact

- **Large Language Models:**
    - Training models like GPT currently takes 3–4 months on A100 GPUs with enormous power draw, heat, and cooling requirements.  
    Our optical GPU architecture could reduce training time to days or even hours, using near-zero electricity and producing no heat — making AI truly accessible.

- **Gaming & Graphics:**
    - Light-based processors allow ultra-realistic real-time graphics by assigning parallel optical logic units per pixel or object.  
    This enables cinematic-quality visuals without power-hungry fans or expensive cooling hardware.

- **Environmental Sustainability:**
    - Massive data centers powered by light instead of electricity could eliminate the need for air conditioning, reducing global carbon footprints significantly.

- **Scientific Discovery:**
    - Accelerated computing power at low cost can enable real-time simulation of physics, chemistry, and biology — opening doors to breakthroughs in medicine and material science.
